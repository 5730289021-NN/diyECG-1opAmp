# diyECG-1opAmp
A surprisingly good ECG is possible from a single op-amp. This project contains circuit and software.

## Setup
I recommend you run this file from its source. Although you could lug around a 160MB python interpreter as a single .EXE, that seems pretty stilly =P

* install [WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/)
* download this project and modify go.bat to reflect where your python.exe is
* build the circuit, plug it into your microphone hole, and run go.bat
